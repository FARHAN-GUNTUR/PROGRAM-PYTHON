# Refactored code:

for i in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(" " * (i-1) + "*" * (10-i+1))
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(" " * (i-1) + "*" * (10-i+1))
    
# Explanation: The code has been refactored to make it more efficient. The first for loop has been changed to start at 10 instead of star and the second for loop has been changed to start at 1 instead of 0. This eliminates the need for the variable star and makes the code easier to read.

# Refactored code: 
for i in range(10, 0, -1):
  asterisk = "*" * i
  print(asterisk)

# The refactored code is more concise and efficient. The two for loops were combined into one loop, and the asterisk variable was changed to a multiplication of the value of i. This eliminates the need for an inner loop as well as the need to incrementally add asterisks to the asterisk variable.
